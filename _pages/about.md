I am a master’s student in the Kahlert School of Computing at the University of Utah, where my research focuses on designing and developing web-based touchscreen tasks to measure cognitive performance. My work aims to improve healthcare tools by creating accessible, user-centered digital solutions.

My research interests include human-computer interaction, digital health, and studying how communities interact with digital tools. I am passionate about creating tools that empower individuals and underserved communities by making advanced technologies more accessible and inclusive.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Vellore Institute of Technology, India. During this time, I worked on developing natural language processing systems, including a language classifier that enhanced virtual assistant responses by incorporating linguistic context. 

When I’m embracing my inner procrastinator, you’ll find me hiking, watching anime, playing video games, or indulging in endless cat videos :)
<!--- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
